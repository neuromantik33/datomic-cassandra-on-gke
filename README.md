# Datomic on Cassandra, running on GKE

This tutorial walks you through setting up a on-prem Datomic-on-Cassandra running in a GKE
cluster. This guide is not for people looking for a fully automated command to bring up a
Datomic deployment. If that's you then check out [Datomic Cloud](https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/index.html).

> The results of this tutorial should not be viewed as production ready,
> but rather as a learning tool, and a quick way to get a datomic on-prem staging environment!
